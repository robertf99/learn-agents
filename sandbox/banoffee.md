# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- **For the pastry:**
  - 100g chilled butter (plus extra for greasing)
  - 200g plain flour
  - 1 medium egg (separated)
  - 1 tbsp golden caster sugar

- **For the filling:**
  - 4 sliced bananas
  - 394g caramel or dulce de leche
  - 300ml double cream (whipped)
  - Dark chocolate (optional, for garnish)

## Method
1. **Make the pastry case:**  
   In a food processor, pulse together the chilled butter and flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and sugar, and pulse until mixed. Gradually add cold water until the dough forms. 
2. **Chill the dough:**  
   Knead the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.
3. **Line the tart tin:**  
   Preheat the oven to 190°C (170°C fan) / Gas 4. Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Roll the dough and line the tin. 
4. **Bake the pastry:**  
   Line with parchment and fill with baking beans or rice. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the paper and beans, brush the base with beaten egg white, and return to the oven for 15-20 minutes until golden. Allow to cool.
5. **Fill with caramel and bananas:**  
   Spread half the caramel over the cooled pastry, layer with bananas, and add the remaining caramel. Chill in the fridge.
6. **Top with cream:**  
   Whip the cream until thick and spread over the tart. Grate dark chocolate on top for garnish.

## Notes
- Serve cold. Enjoy a delectable combination of banana and toffee flavors in this delightful dessert!
